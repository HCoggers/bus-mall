-As a developer, I want to make my page elements uniform, so I can format them around each other more easily.
-As a developer, I want my code to be more DRY, and easily readable, so that if I have to come back in and change something, or another developer does, it is quickly and easily understood.
-As a developer, I want my functions to account for future additions or changes to the product list, so I can make adjustments easily, without having to rewrite entire blocks of code.

-As the marketing team, I want every product given equal prominence on the page, so that a user isn't biased towards a bigger/higher up one.
